## 📱 **Upload to Play Console:**

### **Step 1: Upload AAB**
1. Go to **Play Console** → **Production** → **Create new release**
2. Upload: `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
3. ✅ No more "signing key" error!

### **Step 2: Enable Play App Signing**
1. When prompted, select **"Use Play App Signing"**
2. Google will manage your production signing key
3. Your upload key will be used for future uploads

### **Step 3: Complete Store Setup**
1. Set up **Google Payments merchant account**
2. Create **4 in-app products** with exact IDs:
   - `basic_credits_500` ($9.99)
   - `starter_credits_1300` ($24.99)

## 🔑 **Important Security Information:**

### **⚠️ BACKUP THESE FILES SAFELY:**
```
android/keystore/upload-keystore.jks    # Your keystore file
android/key.properties                  # Your keystore passwords
```

### **🔐 Keystore Details:**
```
File: android/keystore/upload-keystore.jks
Alias: upload
Store Password: CloneX2024!
Key Password: CloneX2024!
Algorithm: RSA 2048-bit
Validity: 10,000 days
```

### **💾 Backup Instructions:**
1. **Copy keystore to 3 safe locations** (cloud storage, USB drives)
2. **Save passwords** in password manager
3. **Never lose these** - you can't update the app without them!

### **After Merchant Approval (1-7 days):**
1. Create 4 in-app purchase products
2. Test purchases with internal testing
3. Launch to production

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If build fails:**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build appbundle --release
```

### **If keystore issues:**
- Check `android/key.properties` paths
- Verify keystore exists in `android/keystore/`
- Ensure passwords match

### **If upload fails:**
- File too large: Use `flutter build appbundle --release --target-platform=android-arm64`
- Wrong format: Use `.aab` not `.apk`
